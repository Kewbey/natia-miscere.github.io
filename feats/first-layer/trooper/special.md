### Moonspawn Affliction (Cost: 0 Point, Story, X)

**Event:** Fail 3 Fort Saves in a row when bitten.

Roll 3 Will Saves with varied DC depending on situation. (Researching may unlock a method to ignore this process) On success, the target retains sanity and reasoning, on fail, it becomes Lesser Moonspawn that only seeks to destroy life.
