## Classifications

Abilities can be classfied into few categories depending on their scale and usage.

### Inept

Making up the bulk of the population, these group of people show 0 affinity or very tiny affinity to ability usage. Investment or training will likely yield no visible effect.

**Example:** Gun group

### Users

Making up the bulk of ability user population, these group of people do realize and are fully aware that they have powers. But their utilization of abilities is limited due to weak nature, lack of proficiency or just flat out void of talent.

Abilities in this category would not be able to engage an armed, trained soldier and win it. Reliance on technology and tools are still heavy in this level.

**Example:** Officer Taco, Skyranger, Aika, Ryan

### Awakened

Moving up to the upper part of the pyramid, awakened ability users starts to become a force to be reckoned with. They may easily handle soldiers or trainined personnel without reliance on weapons. Their abilities can impact their vicinity quite significantly. If the government would track ability users, they would start with this group.

Abilities in this category are more impactful and would require at least a squad of soldiers trained specifically for dealing with ability users. They do not need weapons or tools to enhance their capabilities.

**Example:** Kilo, Moby, Jessica

### Potent

Even further up the pyramid, these ability users can easily be seen as a threat. It would require significant investment of forces to suppress these tier of users. Government would attempt persuasion and negotiations to keep these ability users at bay. Their abilities can drastically impact an entire neighborhood.

Abilities in this category are definitely impactful, and would require hundred of manpower to deal with it in safe, predictable levels.

**Example:** Maids, Kid's Group, Alfa when Alive
